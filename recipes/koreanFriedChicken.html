    <h2>Decsription</h2>
    <p>One of the best dishes that fuses sweet honey and soy sauce flavours with a generous touch of spiciness of Korea's famous gochujang paste</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    <strong>Marinade:</strong>
    <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
    <li>½ yellow onion, grated</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <strong>Other:</strong>
    <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <strong>Batter:</strong>
    <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>½ cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C). </li>
        <li>While oil is heating, make the batter: Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles a smooth batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade. </li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack. </li>
        <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain. </li>
    </ol>
